**I hate repetitive tasks**.

I'd rather spend triple the time automating a task than doing it manually over
and over again. Also, I love coding, and helping my team move faster is a great
feeling.

## Why To Automate?

_Automation is key to efficiency_. When people are not repeatedly doing the same
task, they can focus on more creative and challenging activities that bring more
value overall.

Automation saves time and money, and makes people happier and more productive.

In an ideal world, all systems would be interconnected and most of the processes
would be automatic. Services should expose APIs to interact with, allowing us to
easily integrate them with other systems.

```txt
+---------------+      +-----------------+
|   System A    |      |     System B    |
+---------------+      +-----------------+
        ∧                       ∧
        |    +-------------+    |
        +--->| Integration |<---+
             +-------------+
```

But reality isn't always so pretty. We often have to deal with legacy systems,
or systems that do not offer APIs to interact with.

We should strive to migrate to better systems and services whenever possible,
but in the meantime we still can resort to _browser automation._

```txt
+---------------+      +-----------------+
|   System A    |      |     System B    |
+---------------+      +-----------------+
        ∧                       ∧
        |                       |
        ∨                       ∨
+---------------+      +-----------------+
|   Website A   |      |    Website B    |
+---------------+      +-----------------+
        ∧                      ∧
        |    +------------+    |
        |    | Browser    |    |
        +--->| Automation |<---+
             +------------+
```

Yes, it's not the ideal solution, because it's slower and more fragile than using
APIs, but again, sometimes we must deal with what we have and make the best of it.


## Browser Automation

Browser automation is the process of controlling a web browser through a script
or a program. This allows us to interact with web pages, fill forms, click buttons,
and extract data from websites, just like a human would do, but programmatically.

There are several tools available to achieve this, such as Selenium, Puppeteer,
and Playwright. In this article, we'll focus on Playwright, a relatively new
tool that is gaining popularity due to its simplicity and speed.

I've used Playwright in the past for end-to-end testing, but I recently discovered that it can be used for other purposes, such as web scraping, monitoring, and automating repetitive tasks. It's pretty straightforward to set up and use.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the example code, let's set up a new project and install
Playwright. We will need to have Node.js installed.

```bash
npm init -y
npm install playwright
```

Playwright supports multiple browsers, such as Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

Now we are ready to go.


## Automating a Simple Task

Let's say you have to log in to a website every day to retrieve a list of return
requests, then fill a form with the data in other website, and write the ID back
in the first website to mark it as complete. This is a repetitive task that can be easily automated.

```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright'; // or 'firefox' or 'webkit'

// Open browser
const context = await chromium.launch();

// Open return requests website
const requestsPage = await context.newPage();
await requestsPage.goto('https://some-website.com/return-requests');

// Log in
await loginRequestsPage(requestsPage);

// Get return request data
const requests = await getReturnRequests(requestsPage);

for (const request of requests) {
  // Open send requests website
  const sendPage = await context.newPage();
  await sendPage.goto('https://another-website.com/send-requests');

  // Fill form with return request data
  await fillForm(sendPage, request);

  // Write ID back in the first website
  await writeId(requestsPage, request.id);
}

console.log('All requests processed successfully.');

// Close browser
await context.close();
```

This is just a high-level overview of the process.

- Open the browser.
- Open the first website and log in.
- Get the return requests data.
- For each request, open the second website, log in, fill the form, and write the ID back.
- Close the browser.

As you can see, the code is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. Playwright
provides a simple API to interact with web pages, making it easy to automate tasks.

To see this in more detail, let's implement some of the functions used in the code above.

```javascript
async function loginRequestsPage(page) {
  await page.fill('#username', 'my-username');
  await page.fill('#password', 'my-password');
  await page.click('#login-button');
}

async function getReturnRequests(page) {
  const requests = await page.evaluate(() => {
    const rows = document.querySelectorAll('.return-request');
    return Array.from(rows, row => {
      return {
        id: row.querySelector('.id').innerText,
        date: row.querySelector('.date').innerText,
        status: row.querySelector('.status').innerText,
      };
    });
  });

  return requests;
}
```

We are basically manipulating the DOM of the web pages to interact with them. We
fill forms, click buttons, and extract data from the pages.

This is just a simple example, but you can automate more complex tasks using
Playwright. You can interact with multiple pages, handle popups, download files,
and much more. **It's just JavaScript and DOM manipulation all the way down.**

## Conclusion

With just a few lines of code, you can save hours of manual work by automating browser tasks, using tools like Playwright (or Selenium, Puppeteer, etc).

Just remember to try to integrate systems using APIs whenever possible, as they are faster and more reliable than browser automation. But when you have no other choice, go ahead and script your way through the web.
