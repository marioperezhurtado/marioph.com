[vue](https://vuejs.org/), [preact](https://preactjs.com/),
[solid](https://www.solidjs.com/), [qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/),
[angular](https://angular.io/) and now [svelte](https://svelte.dev/). it seems
like every front-end framework is getting signals. what are they?

in this post, we'll learn about **signals** by implementing a simple
*signal-based* reactive library.

## history of signals

signal-based reactivity is not a new concept. the foundations of [reactive
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) were
laid in the 1970s with the development of electronic spreadsheets and hardware
description languages. also in our context, building **reactive UIs**, the use of signals – also known by various names – has been around for a while.

in **2010**, [knockout.js](https://knockoutjs.com/) introduced *fine-grained*
updates with the use of observables. in **2012**,
[S.js](https://github.com/adamhaile/S) introduced its own primitive for reactive
updates, called *signals*. other not-so-popular libraries have had their own signals all this time, but it wasn't until recently that they seem to be coming back into fashion.

vue, solid, preact, qwik, and angular, have all introduced their own versions of
signals. the [announcement](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes) of svelte 5 with their so-called *"runes"*, is what prompted me to write this article.


## what are signals?

signals represent a single value that changes over time. it is an **atomic reactive
primitive** that updates its value when its *dependencies* change.

signals unlock **fine-grained** reactivity. the following examples will be using
[solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/), but the general concepts apply to any signal-based
library.

take the following example:

```jsx title="counter.jsx"
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const increment = () => count(count() + 1);

  console.log("I only log once");

  return <button onClick={increment}>{count()}</button>;
}
```

this looks pretty much like a [react](https://react.dev/) component, and if you
are familiar with it, you might be wondering what is the difference. there are a few of them, for example:

how many times would the message be logged to the console?

**once**. the function **only ever runs once**, when the component is mounted. that makes
simpler to reason about the component's behavior. for example, we can do this:

```jsx title="counter.jsx" {5}
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(count() + 1);

  setInterval(increment, 1000);
  console.log("I only log once");

  return <button onClick={increment}>{count()}</button>;
}
```

the `count` will be updated every second, and so will the `button`'s text, but
only that will re-run. the console will still only log once. we have achieved **fine-grained reactivity**.

here's another one. how would we change the count state to be global state in this example?

```jsx title="counter.jsx" {1}
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

function Counter() {...}
```

just move it out of the component. **state and component lifecycle are not tied together.** 

how would we produce a *side effect* when the count changes?

```jsx title="counter.jsx" {5-7}
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(count() + 1);

  createEffect(() => {
    console.log('count changed', count());
  });

  return <button onClick={increment}>{count()}</button>;
}
```

**no dependency arrays**. components **only ever run once**, so there is no need
to specify dependencies. the *effect* will run every time the count changes, and only then.

this might seem like some kind of *magic*, maybe a compiler trick, but **it
is not**. the concept itself is fairly simple. let's build our own (naive) implementation of a *signal-based* library.


## implementing a signal-based library

the first thing we need is... *you guessed it*, our **signal**. a signal consists of a
**getter**, a **setter** and a **value**. we'll follow Solid's convention and return them in a tuple.

```js title="signals.js"
function createSignal(value) {
  const read = () => {
    return value;
  };
  const write = (newValue) => {
    value = newValue;
  };

  return [read, write];
}
```

we need to keep track of the signal's **subscribers**. we'll use a `Set` for that.

```js title="signals.js" {2}
function createSignal(value) {
  const subscribers = new Set();
  // ...
}
```

a global **stack** to keep track of the current *observer*.

```js title="signals.js"
const context = [];

function getCurrentObserver() {
  return context[context.length - 1];
}
```

and our **effect** function, wich will push itself onto the *stack*, run the
*callback*, and then pop itself off the *stack*.

```js title="signals.js"
function createEffect(callback) {
  const effect = () => {
    context.push(effect);
    try {
      callback();
    } finally {
      context.pop();
    }
  };

  effect();
}
```

in the signal's `read` function, we'll get the current observer and add it to the
subscribers list.

```js title="signals.js" {5-8}
function createSignal(value) {
  const subscribers = new Set();

  const read = () => {
    const observer = getCurrentObserver();
    if (observer) {
      subscribers.add(observer);
    }
    return value;
  };

  //...
}
```

and in the `write` function, we'll also call every subscriber after the value is
**updated**.

```js title="signals.js" {14}
function createSignal(value) {
  const subscribers = new Set();

  const read = () => {
    const observer = getCurrentObserver();
    if (observer) {
      subscribers.add(observer);
    }
    return value;
  };

  const write = (newValue) => {
    value = newValue;
    subscribers.forEach((sub) => sub());
  };

  return [read, write];
}
```

that's our very basic implementation of a **signal** and an **effect**.

i will recap the code now:

```js title="signals.js"
const context = [];

function getCurrentObserver() {
  return context[context.length - 1];
}

function createSignal(value) {
  const subscribers = new Set();

  const read = () => {
    // 5.
    const observer = getCurrentObserver();
    if (observer) {
      subscribers.add(observer);
    }
    return value;
  };

  const write = (newValue) => {
    // 7.
    value = newValue;
    subscribers.forEach((sub) => sub());
  };

  return [read, write];
}

function createEffect(callback) {
  const effect = () => {
    // 3.
    context.push(effect);
    try {
      // 4.
      callback();
    } finally {
      context.pop();
    }
  };

  effect();
}
```

let's explain, step by step, what would happen if we ran the following code:

```js title="index.js"
// 1.
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

// 2, 8.
createEffect(() => console.log('count changed', count()));

// 6.
setCount(count() + 1);
```

1. we create a **signal** with the value `0`.
2. we create an **effect** with a callback that logs the count.
3. the **effect** pushes itself onto the **stack** and runs its callback.
4. while running the callback, the `count` function is called.
5. because the `count` **read** function is called while there is an
  **effect** running, the effect is now the latest observer, and it is added to
  the subscribers list of the **signal**.
6. when we call the `setCount` function, we call the **write** function of the
  **signal**, which updates the value, then calls every subscriber.
7. we have the **effect** callback in the **signal**'s subscribers list, so it is called.
8. the **effect** callback logs the count, which is `1`.

we have a **reactive system** working! We could manually create `HTML` elements and
update their values using effects:

```js title="index.js" /h1.textContent = count()/
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

const h1 = document.createElement("h1");

createEffect(() => h1.textContent = count());

const button = document.createElement("button");
button.textContent = "click me!";
button.addEventListener("click", () => setCount(count() + 1));

document.body.append(h1, button);
```

the basics of our **signal-based** reactive system are there. but now we could make it
easier to use, so that we don't have to manually create elements and update their
values imperatively, but declaratively, as many frameworks do. let's use
**JSX**. our end result should look like this:

```jsx title="counter.jsx"
function Counter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(props.initialCount);
  const increment = () => setCount(count() + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count() - 1);

  createEffect(() => console.log('count changed', count()));

  return (
    <section>
      <h1>the count is: <span>{count()}</span></h1> 
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </section>
  );
}
```

doesn't that look *familiar*? i am sure it does.

if you **only** wanted to know about what **signals** are, and how they work, you can
stop reading here. the rest of the article will just explain how to implement **JSX** transpiling, so you can see how it works under the hood, and how we actually
have achieved a (very) basic version of a **VDOM-less, signal-based UI
library**. if that is not the case, let's continue.

## using JSX

JSX is a *syntax extension* to javascript that allows us to write **HTML-like** code
in javascript. It is used by react, preact, solid, qwik, and many other libraries.

fortunately, we have *transpilers* that can transform JSX into javascript, so we
don't need to implement it ourselves. we'll use [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to
transform our code.

what happens under the hood when we use JSX in react?

every *HTML-like* tag is transformed into a bunch of function calls. for example,
the following JSX:

```jsx title="hello-world.jsx"
<div>
  <h1>hello world</h1>
</div>
```

Gets transformed into:

```js title="bundle.js"
React.createElement('div', null, React.createElement('h1', null, 'hello world'));
```

where the first argument is the **tag**, the second is the **props**, and the third 
is the **children**. we'll just use the `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` plugin to
transform our code, and we'll implement our own `createElement` function.

i will `npm init` a new project, and install the following dependencies:

```sh
npm install @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx
```

i've named this example library *“Junk”*, and I'm sure you know why. anyway, let's
change the babel configuration, to use the `plugin-transform-react-jsx` with our
custom `createElement` function:

```json title="package.json" {22}
{
  "name": "junk",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "babel index.jsx -d dist"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/cli": "^7.23.0",
    "@babel/core": "^7.23.0",
    "@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx": "^7.22.15"
  },
  "babel": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx",
        {
          "pragma": "Junk.createElement",
          "pragmaFrag": "Junk.Fragment"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

now we need to implement the `createElement` function. it will receive the
**tag**, the **props**, and the **children**, and it will return an element object.

```js title="render.js"
function createElement(tag, props, ...children) {
  // Custom component
  if (isFunction(tag)) {
    return tag({ ...props, children });
  }

  // create DOM element with attributes
  const element = addAttributes(document.createElement(tag), props);

  // append children
  children.flat().forEach((child) => {
    const node = isTextNode(child) ? document.createTextNode(child) : child;

    if (typeof child === 'function') {
      createEffect(() => createExpression(element, child));
    } else {
      if (node) element.appendChild(node);
    }
  });

  return element;
}
```

the `addAttributes` function is just a helper to add the **attributes** to the
element, like event listeners, class names, and other attributes.

```js title="render.js"
function addAttributes(element, props) {
  if (!props) return element;

  Object.entries(props).forEach(([k, v]) => {
    // Add event listener
    if (isEvent(k, v)) {
      element.addEventListener(eventName(k), v);
    } // Add class
    else if (k === 'className') {
      const classes = Array.isArray(v) ? v : [v];
      classes.forEach((c) => element.classList.add(c));
    } // Add attribute
    else {
      element.setAttribute(k, v);
    }
  });

  return element;
}
```

in the `createElement` function, if the child is a function, we create an
**effect** that will run **only** when the expression changes (if it is a
signal), and will update the element with the new value.

```js title="render.js" {7-9}
function createElement(tag, props, ...children) {
  // ...
  // Append children
  children.flat().forEach((child) => {
    const node = isTextNode(child) ? document.createTextNode(child) : child;

    if (typeof child === "function") {
      createEffect(() => createExpression(element, child));
    }
    // ...
  });
  //...
}
``` 

the `createExpression` function changes the element's value. it is super
**flawed**, and does not take into account important things, but it works for
our basic toy example.

```js title="render.js"
function createExpression(element, expression) {
  const result = expression();

  if (isEmpty(result)) {
    element.innerHtml = "";
    return;
  }
                       
  if (isTextNode(result)) {
    element.textContent = result;
    return;
  }

  element.innerHtml = "";
  element.appendChild(result);
}
```

now that we have this `createElement` function, we can use **JSX**, and it will be
transformed in a bunch of calls to our function.

we can implement a simple `render` helper to append the root element of our application
to the entry point on the DOM:

```js title="render.js"
function render(element) {
  document.getElementById('root').appendChild(element);
}
```

and similarly to React (or any other SPA), the entry point of our application
will be a div with the id `root`. our JS code will simply be loaded in our
`index.html` file. It will load, create the elements, and append the root element to the DOM.

```html title="index.html" {8}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Junk</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>

    <script src="./dist/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

our basic UI library now looks like this:

```jsx title="index.jsx"
import { createSignal, createEffect } from "/signals.js";
import { Junk } from "/render.js";

function Counter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(props.initialCount);
  const increment = () => setCount(count() + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count() - 1);

  createEffect(() => console.log('count: ', props.count() * 2)});

  return (
    <section>
      <h1>The count is: <span>{count()}</span></h1> 
      <Double count={count}/>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </section>
  );
}

function Double(props) {
  createEffect(() => console.log('double: ', props.count() * 2)});

  return <span>{props.count() * 2}</span>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>hello world!</h1>
      <Counter initialCount={0} />
    </>
  );
}

Junk.render(<App/>);
```

## conclusion

that's it! we have a working **signal-based library**, and although it is clearly
flawed and incomplete, i think it is a good example to learn about **signals**,
**reactivity**, **JSX**, and how some of these things work (at a basic level)
under the hood, in a practical way.

signals are a really interesting concept that i am really excited about, and i
will keep learning more about this topic. i hope you enjoyed this article, learned something new, and most importantly, **had fun!**
